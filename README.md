# Cause-Consequence-Diagrams-Formalization
Cause-consequence Diagram (CCD) is widely used as a deductive safety analysis technique for decision-making at the critical-system design stage. This approach models the causes of sub-system failures in a highly-critical system and their potential consequences using Fault Tree (FT) and Event Tree (ET) methods, which are well-known dependability modeling techniques. Simulation tools are commonly used
to carry out the CCD analysis, but lacks the ability to rigorously verify the essential system reliability properties. In this paper, we propose to use the HOL4 theorem prover for the formal modeling and analysis of CCDs to overcome the inaccuracies in the simulation-based analysis and the error-prone informal reasoning by mathematical proofs. We demonstrate the practical effectiveness of the proposed CCD formalization by performing the formal CCD-based reliability analysis of the IEEE 39-bus electrical power network and formally determine its reliability index, i.e., System Average Interruption Duration Index (SAIDI).
